Newsletter Automation System Documentation
Overview
The Newsletter Automation System is a Google Apps Script-based solution that automates the process of sending personalized emails to multiple recipients using data from a Google Spreadsheet. The system is designed to run automatically on a weekly schedule, managing email distribution while maintaining a record of sent messages.
System Components

The system uses a Google Spreadsheet as its data source with the following columns:

Column A: Recipient email addresses

Column C: Email message content
Column D: Sent status tracking

Automation Script
The core automation script handles:

Reading data from the spreadsheet
Validating email addresses
Sending emails via Gmail
