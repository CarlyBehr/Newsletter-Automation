Requirements:
The script should use Gmail to send the emails.
The newsletter content should be pulled from a Google Sheet. Each row in the sheet contains information for one email (e.g., recipient email address, subject line, and message body).
The script should run automatically every week (e.g., every Monday morning at 9 AM).
Structure:
The Google Sheet is structured as follows:
Column A: Recipient email address
Column B: Email subject line
Column C: Email message body
Column D: (Optional) A “Sent” status column that marks whether the email has already been sent.
The script should only send emails to rows where the “Sent” column is blank.
Additional Features:
After sending an email, the script should update the “Sent” column with the date it was sent to avoid duplicate sends.
If possible, include error handling for situations like missing email addresses or blank rows.
Trigger:
Set up a time-based trigger in Google Apps Script so the script runs weekly without manual intervention.
